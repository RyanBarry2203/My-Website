                    <h2>The Book Nerd Company</h2>

                    <p>This Website Reviews Books and attempts to try and reinvigorate reading as a predominant hobby. 
                    With the affect social media and "scrolling" has on our day to day behaviour, we aim to try and 
                    revert its effects as much as possible by bringing back reading. 
                    Reading focuses the mind and brings it discipline, almost the complete opossosite of what endlessly scrolling on your phone can achieve.
                    Reading can bring our minds back to a more desirable level of focus and discipline.
